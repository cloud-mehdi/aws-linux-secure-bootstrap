# Phase 4 – SSH Alias Configuration

To simplify SSH access, an SSH alias was configured on the local machine.

Instead of typing the full SSH command each time, an alias was added to
the SSH client configuration file (~/.ssh/config).

After this configuration, the server can be accessed using:
ssh aws

This improves productivity and reduces human error during daily operations.
