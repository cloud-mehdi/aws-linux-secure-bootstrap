# Phase 1 – EC2 Instance Creation

An EC2 instance was created on AWS with the following configuration:

- Operating System: Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS
- Instance Type: t3.micro
- Authentication: SSH key pair
- Network Security: SSH access restricted to my public IP

The goal of this phase was to create a minimal and secure cloud instance
using AWS best practices.
